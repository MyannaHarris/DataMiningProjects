Data Mining

1) 
If there is 0 occurances of one attribute, the total probability becomes 0.
Used methods to set up general class probabilities so we wouldn't have to calculate it multiple times.
It is hard to keep this methods general, especially with the special rankings.

2) 
The continuous requires more total stats.
It is pretty close to the same code but its easier to make new methods for it.

3) 
Assumed that if the categorical values didn't equal each other, they had a difference of 1.
Takes a few seconds to finish.
K-NN was doing really bad based upon some code we used from the previous assignment - ignoring lines that were the same majorly skewed our data to almost always return the wrong classification.
