Log / Prunning / output

1)  The algorithm works well for titanic data
    The helper methods were nice
    Treating everything as categorical makes it easier
    
2)  MPG is harder
    The accuracy is bad
    I'm not sure why the Enew is calculated badly for MPG, the log seems to have problems
    
3)  This was okay
    Used a queue and recursion
    This project lends itself well to recursion
    This we did before 2 and it helped with debugging
    
Part 3 Prunning:

1) Titanic
For males, we can prune all att3's becuase it doesn't change the class.
For females who are second or third class we can prune att3's becuase it doesn't change the class.

IF att1 = male and att2 = second THEN class = yes
IF att1 = male and att2 = crew THEN class = no
IF att1 = male and att2 = third THEN class = no
IF att1 = male and att2 = first THEN class = no
IF att1 = female and att2 = second THEN class = yes
IF att1 = female and att2 = crew and att3 = adult THEN class = yes
IF att1 = female and att2 = crew and att3 = child THEN class = no
IF att1 = female and att2 = third THEN class = yes
IF att1 = female and att2 = first and att3 = adult THEN class = yes
IF att1 = female and att2 = first and att3 = child THEN class = no

2) MPG
We can prune a lot of the att3's because they dont change the class for cetain combinations of att1 and att2.
